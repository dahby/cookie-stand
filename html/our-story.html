      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>Pat's Salmon Cookies was born out of the wild imagination of our founder, Pat Smith. Starting out at his coastal home, Pat discovered that salmon, when finely ground, transferred its amazingly delicious fishy flavor and texture to anything he put it in. And who doesn't love salmon?</p>
      <p>Pat also had a deep love for cookies. Using his great-grandmother's cookie recipe, he modified the recipe to include as much salmon as possible and hawking these items at the local farmers market. Word has spread throughout the Seattle area, generating a cult following for these delicious baked goods.</p>
      <p>We're so glad that you've found your way here. That means you're an adventurous person and you should be proud of that. Treat yo self next time you're near one of our five locations and dive into the depths of deliciousness.</p>
